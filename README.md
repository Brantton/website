# B. Montiel Co

Welcome to my personal website — built from scratch with HTML and CSS, centered around simplicity and self-expression.


## 📁 Pages

- **Home** – A minimal landing page with a quote
- **About** – A personal introduction
- **Gear** – A list of the tools and items I use
- **Pomodoro** – A timer for focused work
- **Contact** – Email and social links

## 📅 Planned Updates

In the near future, I plan to:
- Add a **Daily Tasks** page to track progress and productivity.
- Launch a **Blog** section to share notes, reflections, and tech thoughts.

Stay tuned!
